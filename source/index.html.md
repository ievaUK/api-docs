# Introduction

Welcome to the Parakeet API

The Parakeet API Platform provides programmatic access to your Parakeet account that you can use to build custom integrations with your own applications.

If you have any questions getting started with the API, or would like to see something else added here that we don't currently support, please [contact us](mailto:support@parakeet.is)
